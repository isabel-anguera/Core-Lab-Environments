		<p>The people in line are friendly, and you start talking to them as you wait. Eventually it's your turn and you start climbing up a chair that they've cut notches out of. You run around the course for a while, and when you get tired you sit at the top of a table and look out over the seemingly huge room. You think about your experience, and you talk to the new people you've met who are also having this crazy experience. People start to revert to their normal size and leave, so at a point you do to. <button><a href="9.html">Revert</a></button></p>
